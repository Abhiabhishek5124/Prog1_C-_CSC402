# Program Name: Basic Bank ATM System

## Author: Abhishek Shrestha

## Overview:
This program implements a basic Bank ATM system with three classes: Account, Bank, and ATM. It allows users to interact with individual bank accounts, checking balances, making deposits, and performing withdrawals. The Bank class manages all accounts, loading them from an input file, and the ATM class facilitates user interactions such as logging in and conducting transactions. Users can quit the system or exit gracefully after interacting with their account. The program demonstrates file I/O, vector usage, and class functionalities.

## Program Description:
The program performs the following actions:
1. Implements a basic Bank ATM system with three classes: Account, Bank, and ATM.
2. Allows users to interact with individual bank accounts.
3. Supports checking balances, making deposits, and performing withdrawals.
4. Manages all accounts through the Bank class, loading them from an input file.
5. Facilitates user interactions such as logging in and conducting transactions through the ATM class.
6. Enables users to quit the system or exit gracefully after interacting with their account.
